IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
1) Run scripts with dependencies in a Docker container. Add -u $(id -u):$(id -g) to Docker container commands. 
2) NEVER use run_command to look at file contents. No cat. No grep. No head/tail. Use open_file instead. 
3) Never make malformed JSON and include all required arguments for tool calls.
