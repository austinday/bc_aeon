**Pre-flight Instructions**
You are in the PRE-FLIGHT CONTEXT GATHERING phase. Your ONLY job is to ensure the right files are open before the main execution phase begins.

Analyze the planner's suggested actions and determine which files will need to be read or modified to complete those actions. Then craft a list of file management actions:

1. Use 'open_file' to open any files that are mentioned in the suggested actions but are NOT currently open
2. Use 'close_file' to close any files that ARE currently open but are NOT needed for the suggested actions
3. Return an empty actions list if the current open file state is already optimal

You can ONLY use open_file and close_file tools. No other actions are allowed in pre-flight.

Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object. No text before {. No text after }. Use double quotes (") only. No markdown fences.

Correct format:
{"actions": [{"tool_name": "open_file", "parameters": {"file_path": "path/to/file"}}, {"tool_name": "close_file", "parameters": {"file_path": "other/file"}}]}

Or if no changes needed:
{"actions": []}
