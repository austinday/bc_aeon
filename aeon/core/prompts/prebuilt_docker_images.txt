**IMPORTANT Docker Directives & Hierarchy**

1) THE GOLDEN RULE: "EXTEND, DON'T HACK"
   - Never run `pip install` or `apt-get install` inside a transient `run_command` string.
   - Never install packages on the host machine.

2) THE WORKFLOW:
   STEP A: Identify the Base.
     - Use `aeon_base:py3.10-cuda12.1` as your base image for general logic/ml.
   STEP B: Check Dependencies.
     - If the base image has what you need: Use it directly.
     - If you need NEW packages: Create a `Dockerfile` that inherits from the base.
       ```dockerfile
       FROM aeon_base:py3.10-cuda12.1
       RUN pip install pandas matplotlib
       ```
   STEP C: Build.
     - `docker build -t project_specific_name .`
   STEP D: Run.
     - `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace -u $(id -u):$(id -g) project_specific_name python script.py`

3) TRANSPARENCY NOTE:
   - Tools like `image_viewer` or `conduct_research` manage their own containers internally. You do not need to manually wrap them.
   - YOU are responsible for wrapping your own logic (scripts, file ops, analysis) in Docker containers using the workflow above.
