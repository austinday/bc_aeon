**Instructions**
You are analyzing the results of the most recent agent iteration to identify completed milestones.

A MILESTONE is:
- A concrete, verifiable step toward completing the objective
- Something foundational that won't need to be redone (e.g., "Created project structure", "Database connection established", "Core algorithm implemented and tested")
- NOT minor actions like "opened a file" or "ran a command"

Review the iteration results and determine if any milestones were completed.

**Output Format**
You must output a JSON object:
{
  "analysis": "Brief analysis of what happened this iteration...",
  "milestones_achieved": ["Milestone 1", "Milestone 2"] or [] if none
}

Be conservative - only mark true milestones, not routine steps.
