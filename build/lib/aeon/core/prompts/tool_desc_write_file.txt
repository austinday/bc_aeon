Writes or overwrites an entire file. Creates parent directories if needed. Use when creating new files or when changes are too extensive for edit_file. For small targeted edits, prefer edit_file instead.
Schema:
  file_path (str, required): Path to the file to write. Created if it does not exist; overwritten if it does.
  content (str, required): The complete file content. Prefix with "base64:" for base64-encoded content.
Example: {"tool_name": "write_file", "parameters": {"file_path": "test.py", "content": "import sys\nprint(sys.version)"}}
