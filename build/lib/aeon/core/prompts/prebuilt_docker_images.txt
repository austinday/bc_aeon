**IMPORTANT Docker Directives**
1) For every complex project, run scripts using a .sh script that calls the .py script using a Docker container.
2) No Docker for simple edits or answers
3) Docker MUST be used for managing environments, adapt other methods into docker
4) Use of existing Dockerfile/image/container is allowed, but use pre-built images if possible.
5) Use DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y when installing packages to prevent interactive prompts.
6) Available pre-built images to use: aeon_base:py3.10-cuda12.1
7) Add -u $(id -u):$(id -g) to all docker container commands
8) GPU ACCESS: ALWAYS add `--gpus all` to docker run commands when GPU/CUDA is needed. Without this flag, the container has NO GPU access even if the host has GPUs.
9) TWO WORLDS DOCTRINE: The Host (World A) orchestrates Docker; the Container (World B) runs code. Host files are invisible to the Container unless you explicitly COPY them during build or mount (-v) them at runtime.
10) VOLUME MOUNTING: To give the container access to host files at runtime, use `-v /host/path:/container/path`. Example: `-v $(pwd):/workspace -v ~/huggingface_access_token.txt:/root/.cache/huggingface/token`
