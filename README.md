# Aeon Agent

This repository contains the codebase for the Aeon Agent, a hyper-capable AI agent designed for perpetual, autonomous engineering tasks. It includes:

- Core modules for LLM integration, logging, system monitoring, and worker processes.
- Tools for file I/O, editing, summarization, Docker management, memory handling, learning, and more.
- Specialized analyzers and handlers for various file types (e.g., code, data, documents).
- Configuration files like Dockerfile, setup.py, and requirements.txt for environment setup.

The agent operates with directives for safe, efficient problem-solving, using Docker for isolated environments and Git for version control.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .`
3. Run: `aeon` (or `python aeon/main.py`)
